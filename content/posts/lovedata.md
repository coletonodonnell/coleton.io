Recently I was asked what I do in my free time, and among other things, I
named my love for what is known as "Data Hoarding." This piqued the interest
of the person who asked and I went onto explain what data hoarding entailed.
Once they understood, they were confused about the appeal of data hoarding. The definition and
motivations of data hoarding differ from person to person. Some say they data
hoard so that they can have all of their content in the same place, whilst
others believe in a grander purpose, the preservation and protection of
information for generations in the future. As we march ever further into the digital age, astronomical
quantities of information are created each and every day. Millions of examples
of music, videos, forms, documents, papers, essays, books, pictures, etc. pour
onto our digital landscape waiting for someone to gaze upon it. The beauty of
this fact is that we have more information on any given subject than any society so far
in the entirety of human history. We have substantial knowledge not only of
our current day but also of centuries past. All of this is chaotically spewn
about, loosely organized by web crawlers and gathered on indexes. This chaos
leads to a lack of protection, every day as more data is added, more is lost.
It isn't uncommon for services to truncate large quantities of data without
giving a thought to its significance. Services go offline, servers go down,
content is removed, **data is lost.**

Although we have such a large amount of information, it can be difficult to
preserve all of this data, if not impossible. Of course, like all things information
is lost. We can't take a perfect snapshot of our current time representing all
facets of the world scene. Instead, we will always have little holes in our
knowledge of history. Although this is the case, the digital age has allowed
us to document and archive nearly all facets of our day. This is the
motivation: preservation and subsequent protection of a wide variety of
information. What could be viewed as "useless" information for us today could be
viewed as pivotal information in the study of our day and age. Yes, data
hoarding is not an exercise of selfishness but an exercise of gift-giving, the
gifts being neatly wrapped packages of data for our descendants and peers. Have you ever looked for a video and realized it was removed, but
found it reuploaded elsewhere? Have you ever tried to find a site, realized it
was down and found a snapshot of it on Internet Archive? These efforts are an
example of archivists and data hoarders at work.

But, with this being said, let us look a bit broader. Though the main motivation
of data hoarding is to protect data, there is another that is equally
important. This is the decentralization of information. Knowledge is the human
extension of information. In other words, knowledge is merely our
internalization of information. It would be safe to assume then that the
information we are exposed to directly influences our knowledge. A lack of
information would indicate a lack of knowledge. In every example of the great farces of
history, authoritarians and fascists, tyrants and dictators, control of the
people is the ultimate goal. What is the best way of controlling people?
Ignorance. The control of information is the most effective way of controlling
knowledge and keeping the general population in check. Things that go against
the status quo are expunged and manipulated. This isn't just something from
science fiction, a 1984 scenario, we see the control of information in many
countries today. China and North Korea for example control most (if not all) of the information coming in and
out of their nations, and as a result many resources are completely blocked
off from access. This limits the information, limits knowledge, and grants
power.

Evidently, control of information and thus control of knowledge is power. My
love for data hoarding comes from the act of preservation and empowerment, both for future generations
and the present. The decentralization of information helps ensure a longer life
span, both from natural losses such as the service hosting it going down, but
also outside factors such as attacks on the source. This idea of decentralization is integral to data hoarding: the more copies you have, the
better the chance it won't be lost, expunged, or manipulated. Don't put all
your eggs in one basket.

In conclusion, data hoarding is a fun hobby and is something that I am happy I have gotten into. 
From aggregating the data to distribution, each step of
the process is enjoyable, but the most enjoyable thing is knowing that you are
helping preserve a piece of history. In the unfortunate event that something
is lost, you can fill in that missing puzzle piece. This is a great feeling
and reminds you why you're doing this. If you want to investigate more about
data hoarding and join a community of like-minded individuals, I would head
over to [r/DataHoarder.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/) There is
plenty to read and learn about when it comes to data hoarding. Getting
involved is one of the best ways to learn fast.
